# Stage #4 - Module 9

## Description

In this module we learn the brand new React Hooks features to simplify many life cycle methods usage and allow more flexibility both in React and React-Redux. We're taught the following:

- React: useState and how it handle a functional component state;
- React: useEffect and how it replaces life cycle methods, plus watching specific state data;
- React: useCallback and how it alleviates overused component functions which deal with state data;
- React: useMemo and how it prevents overhead by running certain calculations only when state changes;
- Redux: useSelector to greatly simplify state management syntax and usage;
- Redux: useDispatch to dispatch actions way more simpler.
