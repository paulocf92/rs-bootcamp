# Stage #4 - Module 8

## Description

In this module we dive deeper into the Flux Architecture and how it behaves within ReactJS. We're also taught a handful of tools for dealing with state management as well as other, miscellaneous libs:

- Redux concepts;
- Local api with json-server;
- Reactotron for managing redux;
- Implementing flux architecture through actions and reducers;
- Saga integration with redux, delegating redux logic to sagas;
- React Toastify for server notifications;
- Routing with history from Redux Saga.
