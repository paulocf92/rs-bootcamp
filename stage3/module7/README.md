# Stage #3 - Module 7

## Description

In this module we create our first React Native (RN) project using development tools covered in previous modules. We understand the differences between a ReactJS workflow and a RN workflow as well as some particularities between them:

- React Navigation;
- StatusBar settings;
- Styled Components for RN and how it differs from ReactJS;
- Chained components and their respective styles;
- FlatList for seamlessly looping through an array of data;
- Persisting data in AsyncStorage;
- Navigating between pages (namely RN components);
- How different RN behaves in iOS and Android.
